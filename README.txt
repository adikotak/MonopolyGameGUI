Dear Mr. Peck, 

For our JUnit test, we made our original test for our text based version of the game.
Therefore, we have two groups of code as part of our one submission. One is the actual project which is GUI
based. The second is a zip file for the source for our text based game (and the JUnit). So although it may
seem that our JUnit is not there, we actually have it in our zip. 

Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused. 

Sincerely,
William Wang, Aditya Kotak, Rhaul Sarathy.
